# The Tigrillo Robot Control Library
This library implements basic functions to read external sensors and actuate
motors over UART with a Tigrillo robot. It is Platform dependent and has no
direct use for another platform.

## Requirements
 - Boards: tested on a Raspberry Pi (ARM Cortex-A53) connected to an OpenCM
 board to control Dynamixel servomotors ARM. For more documentation on the
 platforms, check the folder platforms
 - OS: tested on Ubuntu Mate 16.04.2
 - Python dependencies on the RPI (installed with pip): pause, Adafruit_GPIO,
